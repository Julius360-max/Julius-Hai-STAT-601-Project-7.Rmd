# STAT 601 ‚Äì Week 7 Project

This repository contains my R Markdown (`.Rmd`) and rendered PDF file for Week 7 of STAT 601: Modern Applied Statistics I.  
The assignment focuses on Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), assumption testing, and interpretation of model results using real-world statistical reasoning.

## üß† Topics Covered

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ One-Way ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)
The **one-way ANOVA** test is used to compare the means of three or more independent groups to determine whether at least one mean differs significantly.  
It evaluates the ratio of variance **between groups** to the variance **within groups** to determine whether group means differ more than expected by random chance.  

- **Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ):** All group means are equal.  
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H‚Çê):** At least one group mean differs.  

The F-statistic is used to test this hypothesis, and a p-value below 0.05 typically indicates a statistically significant difference.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Assumption Testing in ANOVA
ANOVA assumes:
- **Normality:** Residuals should be approximately normally distributed (tested using the Shapiro‚ÄìWilk test or QQ plot).  
- **Homogeneity of Variances:** Group variances should be equal (tested using Levene‚Äôs Test).  
- **Independence:** Observations must be independent of one another.  

Violations of these assumptions can affect the validity of the F-test, so diagnostic checks are performed before interpreting results.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Levene‚Äôs Test for Equality of Variances
**Levene‚Äôs Test** assesses whether the variances across groups are equal ‚Äî a key assumption of ANOVA.  
- **H‚ÇÄ:** All group variances are equal.  
- **H‚Çê:** At least one group variance differs.  
If *p < 0.05*, variances are unequal, and ANOVA assumptions may not hold.  
This test provides a robust way to verify model assumptions even under moderate departures from normality.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Shapiro‚ÄìWilk Test and QQ Plot for Normality
The **Shapiro‚ÄìWilk Test** checks whether residuals follow a normal distribution:  
- **H‚ÇÄ:** Data are normally distributed.  
- **H‚Çê:** Data are not normally distributed.  

A p-value greater than 0.05 suggests that normality holds. The **QQ plot** visually supports this check ‚Äî points lying near the diagonal line indicate approximate normality.  
Together, these methods confirm whether the data meet ANOVA‚Äôs normality assumption.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Interpretation of the F-Test
The **F-test** statistic measures the ratio of between-group variance to within-group variance.  
A large F-value relative to its critical value suggests that group means differ more than expected by chance.  
The p-value determines whether this difference is statistically significant:  
- If *p < 0.05* ‚Üí Reject H‚ÇÄ (at least one mean differs).  
- If *p ‚â• 0.05* ‚Üí Fail to reject H‚ÇÄ (no significant difference).  

Interpretation connects statistical outcomes to real-world meaning ‚Äî for example, identifying which treatment or process yields the best performance.
